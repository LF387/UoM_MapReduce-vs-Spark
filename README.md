# UoM_MapReduce-vs-Spark

Hadoop is used for storing and processing a huge amount of data, for storing it uses HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and for processing its uses MapReduce. For analysing hive can be used which uses hiveQL statement which runs over MapReduce framework to analyse the data. And also, analysis can be done by using spark which uses Spark-SQL and runs over spark framework. Query execution time comparison is analysed for the delayed flight dataset freely available on Kaggle.
