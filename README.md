# UoM_MapReduce-vs-Spark

Hadoop is a widely used tool for managing large amounts of data, where it utilizes the HDFS for storing data and MapReduce for processing it. For data analysis, there are multiple options available such as Hive, which uses HiveQL statements that run on the MapReduce framework, and Spark, which utilizes Spark-SQL and runs on the Spark framework. To compare query execution times, one can use freely available datasets like the Delayed Flight dataset on Kaggle.
