If your file is stored in CSV format in the S3 bucket, you can use the following HiveQL commands to create an external table and read the data in hive:
"s3://flight-delay-wip/input/" is the actual path to your CSV file in S3.

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE table3 (
  Id INT,
  Year INT,
  Month INT,
  DayofMonth INT,
  DayOfWeek INT,
  DepTime FLOAT,
  CRSDepTime INT,
  ArrTime FLOAT,
  CRSArrTime INT,
  UniqueCarrier STRING,
  FlightNum INT,
  TailNum STRING,
  ActualElapsedTime FLOAT,
  CRSElapsedTime FLOAT,
  AirTime FLOAT,
  ArrDelay FLOAT,
  DepDelay FLOAT,
  Origin STRING,
  Dest STRING,
  Distance FLOAT,
  TaxiIn FLOAT,
  TaxiOut FLOAT,
  Cancelled STRING,
  CancellationCode STRING,
  Diverted STRING,
  CarrierDelay FLOAT,
  WeatherDelay FLOAT,
  NASDelay FLOAT,
  SecurityDelay FLOAT,
  LateAircraftDelay FLOAT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION 's3://flight-delay-wip/input/';

To disable the default behavior of Hive to validate the partition directories in the table. This is useful when the partitions have been added manually or through a different process.

set hive.msck.path.validation=ignore;

To repair the table by adding any partitions that are missing. This command is useful when partitions have been added manually to the storage location outside of Hive.

MSCK REPAIR TABLE table3;

To provide metadata information about the table including its schema, partition information, table location, storage format, and more.

describe formatted table3;



SELECT Year, avg((CarrierDelay /ArrDelay)*100) FROM table3 GROUP BY Year;

SELECT Year, avg((NASDelay /ArrDelay)*100) FROM table3 GROUP BY Year;

SELECT Year, avg((WeatherDelay /ArrDelay)*100) FROM table3 GROUP BY Year;

SELECT Year, avg((LateAircraftDelay /ArrDelay)*100) FROM table3 GROUP BY Year;

SELECT Year, avg((SecurityDelay /ArrDelay)*100) FROM table3 GROUP BY Year;
